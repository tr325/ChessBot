I decided to write a Chess Bot.

You can play against yourself from the command line using ```python3 main.py``` -- it's not yet finished, so some issues are expected. Eventually the program will play against you.

Run all engine tests with:

```python3 -m unittest discover -s engine/test/```

or all interface tests with:

```python3 -m unittest discover -s interface/test/```

from the root directory.
